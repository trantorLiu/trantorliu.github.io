## More about the [ArmyApp](http://armyapp.org)
It's an app I built with my college friends when I was a second lieutenant chief counselor at Republic of China Armed Forces. It help soldiers to report their locations during their vacation in 3 seconds. It caused a sensation in the army and became [a news](http://armyapp.org/#video) in Taiwan. And thus the Chief of the Republic of China Army gave a prize to me. The Army Command Headquarters also gave me a chance to lead a short term project to digitalize some information in the army.
